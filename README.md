## Introduction:
### Problem Statement
To prevent the crimes from happening, the police needs to identify the major areas which might be a potential crime hotspot.For better survelliance, they also need to know the statistics of any particular area.A lot of people travel but how would they know whether they're going to a safe place or not. What if a citizen just wants to report a crime online?

### Solution
'Safe Haven', a web application based on  Machine Learning Algorithms. 

Based on user's current location, and some other factors related to the
location, it predicts the crime rate of the area.

#### Citizens can signup as Users to:

                   1. Check the crime rate of the area they are in.

                   2. Report any crime.

                   3. Use the SOS feature in case of emergency. 

#### Police personnels can use the platform to:

                   1. See the crime hotspots of any particular area. 

                   2. View the statistic such as the most prevalent crime types, peak crime     

                        time etc.       

                   3. View the reported crimes.
